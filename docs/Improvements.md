# cheapBuy Phase 4 Improvements
<br><br>
Following are the improvements made in Phase 4 of the project:

## **1. Fetching the cheapest product from each website:**
<br>
Previously in code, they fetched the first product from each website irrespective of its price. So, we implemented code in such a way that it sorts out the product list and then displays the cheapest one from each website.<br>

<br>

## **2. Improve user interface:**
<br>
The UI theme has been modified to make it more readable and made it presentable with an appropriate color palette. 
The price range is removed as we are looking for the cheapest product across all websites or on a website.<br>

## **3. Enhanced the search feature:**
<br>
We enhanced the search feature by replacing search with link by searching with product description. This way we would be able to make the website user-friendly.<br>

## **4. Further improving the accuracy of product results and speed:**
<br>
We have removed loops, used a dictionary, and reduced the time complexity. Furthermore, this change will improve accuracy as there is no link and there is only a product description.<br>

## **5. Decreased the latency by removing driver code:**
<br>
We removed the driver code in order to decrease the latency of the website, enhancing maintainability, and enabling code reuse, while also allowing for parallel execution and flexibility in choosing scraping methods, resulting in more efficient and adaptable web scraping solutions.<br>

## **6. Fix issues and improve web scrapping speed on each website:**
<br>
We successfully resolved proxy issues impacting the scraping process by optimizing proxy server configurations and adjusting request headers to ensure compatibility. Thus, decreasing the latency<br>
