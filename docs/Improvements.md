# cheapBuy Phase 4 Improvements
<br><br>
Following are the improvements made in Phase 4 of the project:
## **1. Improve user interface:**
<br><br>
The UI theme has been modified to make it more readable and made it presentable with an appropriate color palette. 
The price range is removed as we are looking for the cheapest product across all websites or in a website.<br>

## **2. Enhanced the search feature:**
